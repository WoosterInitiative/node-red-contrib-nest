node-red-contrib-nest
=====================

Node-Red (http://nodered.org) nodes for communicating with Nest thermostats and smoke detectors. 
This is still a work in progress so there are UI bugs and the automation of the OAUTH2 token 
generation process needs improvement. 


#Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

	npm install node-red-contrib-nest

You will need a Nest device and a <A HREF="https://developer.nest.com">Nest Developer Program</A> account.

Login to the Nest developer portal and create a client app (i.e. Node-Red), choosing which types of data you wish to make available for read and/or write.

From here on in this install is more complicated than it needs to be. This is temporary and will be replaced by an automated process once I setup a GUI config dialog in Node-Red. In the meantime...

Complete the Nest Developer client app registration forms, leaving the Redirect URI blank to force the PINCODE authentication process.

Follow steps 1 - 3 outlined on the <A HREF="https://developer.nest.com/documentation/cloud/how-to-auth#credentials">How to set up Authorization</A> page of the nest developer portal to generate a PIN and exchange it for an access token. Step three can be executed from the command line using the following curl command:

    curl -X POST "https://api.home.nest.com/oauth2/access_token?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&code=YOUR_PINCODE&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=authorization_code"

Cut and paste the access token into the Node-Red nest config dialog box. 


#Usage

The nest node will appear in it's own "Nest" catagory on the Node-Red pallet. Drag and drop it onto the canvas and configure as you would any other node-red module with both input and output. 

The nest node allows you to select the type of device (thermostat or smoke/CO detector) or structure that you want to query. If the ID field is blank it will return all devices or structures on the account.

The nest node allows you to select "streaming" mode. When streaming is true, the nest node will continuously send messages out whenever there is a change in the data on the device. The nest also sends "null" heartbeat messages every 30 seconds to indicate the connection is still up. If streaming is false, then it acts as a one time request response and emits only one output message for each input message.
