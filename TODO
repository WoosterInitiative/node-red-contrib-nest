TODO
-map incoming topic name to a nest query URL so upstream nodes can set the device type and name by publishing on topics
-map the "path" of streaming responses to the output topic so downstream nodes know what device or path the data came from
-test with more than one device (I just have one)
-test with smoke detector (I only own a thermostat)
-decide how to handle the EventSource keep alive messages in streaming mode (it sends a null message now)
-handle cleanup/disconnect of streaming connections properly (to avoid duplicate or state connections)
-implement setting (HTTP PUT/PATCH) in addition to getting (HTTP GET) of nest endpoints
-make a dedicated node for getting and setting ETA and Home/Away values so that home automation can be programmed based on estimated time of arrival
